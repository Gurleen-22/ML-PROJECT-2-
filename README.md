**Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the tragic event using a logistic regression model. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
The dataset was first cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping irrelevant columns. Visual exploration was then performed to uncover patterns in survival based on features like gender, passenger class, and fare.

To complete this project, the following Python libraries were used:
1. Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
2. NumPy – for numerical operations
3. Seaborn – for statistical data visualization
4. Matplotlib – for plotting graphs and charts
5. Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating the logistic regression model

Logistic regression was chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems like this one.
